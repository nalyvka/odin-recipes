            <p>
                This recipe uses Skyr (pronounced as 'skeer'), an all-time local favorite in Iceland usually served at breakfast; it's a thick, tangy yogurt made by curdling strained milk and is high in protein (as an added bonus).

                Steps

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
                    <li>Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Mix in blueberry yogurt, honey, and lemon zest.</li>
                    <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add to the yogurt mixture and mix until well combined. Fold in blueberries using a spatula.</li>
                    <li>Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
